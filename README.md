# libvl53
A small, fully functional VL53L0x library with an interactive test utility included.

This repository comprises the following:
- A redesign/rewrite of the published “API” for the VL53L0x ranging sensor
- An interactive command-line utility which, using libvl53, allows the user to set up all published device parameters and control ranging operations.

libvl53.docx has more detail.  The format was chosen for ease in showing the equations used in the library.
